# 🚗 Car Listings Pricing & Usage Analysis | Excel Dashboard Project

Welcome to the **Car Listings Usage & Pricing Analysis Dashboard**, built using **Microsoft Excel**!  
This project analyzes 10,000 real-world car listings to explore pricing patterns, fuel preferences, mileage effects, and ownership history in the used car market.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

This project aims to uncover key insights about used car pricing and user behavior by answering:

- What car brands are most frequently listed?
- How does **fuel type**, **transmission**, or **engine size** affect price?
- Is there a relationship between **price and mileage**, or **number of previous owners**?
- How do car listings vary across **manufacturing years**?
